# Windows 10 Charms Bar
It is my intention to build a free application that will serve as a standin charms bar for the Windows 10 Operating system (maybe windows 7 and 8 if it works). It should be noted that I am a beginner in terms of C# programming as such not all of the code will be my own and I will try to source the original location of pieces I've gathered such as the mousekeyhood (Copyright (c) 2004-2015, George Mamaladze
All) pluggin to handle global mouse and keyboard events.

**Development:**
I used Visual Studio Community 2015 and C#. The development process was on my Windows 10 Lenovo T420.
